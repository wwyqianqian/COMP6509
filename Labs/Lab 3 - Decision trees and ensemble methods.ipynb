    "Notice that the numbers of data observations per class are different. We usually refer to this kind of problems as \"imbalanced\". Bear in mind that when creating your training data, you need to account for this imbalance and be aware against misleading results. For example, accuracy is probably not a good metric to measure performance in these problems. Say you have a binary classification problem for which your test data consists of 100 instances. From those, 99 instances belong to class 1, say 'ham', and 1 instance belong to class 2, say 'spam'. When you test your classifier on these instances, you could have a classifier that only is able to predict class 1 correctly, but elements of class 2 are predicted incorrectly. If you apply this classifier to your test data, you would get 99% accuracy. Looking at this percentage out of context and saying that you have produced a highly realiable classifier is completely wrong since your classifier only learned to correctly classify instances in class 1. The problem gets worse if your test set is large, say 100,000 instances, 99,000 are correctly predicted for class 1 and 1,000 are incorrectly predicted for class 2. Even when the classifier fails in correctly predicted 1,000 instances from class 2, the accuracy of this classifier would be 99%.\n",

Some stategies include: i) under-sampling the majority class(es), ii) over-sampling the minority class, and iii) combining over- and under-sampling.

    "In machine learning, we use the term ensemble model to refer to a predictive model that is a composition of several other predictive models. For example, for a classification problem, we can have an ensemble of three classifiers, where the first of them is a decision tree classifier, the second one is a logistic regressor (to be studied in Session 6) and the third one is a shallow neural network. We can train all classifiers with the same training data and then, at test time, predictions can be done using majority voting. \n",

    "Ensemble methods are very popular since they usually show higher performance when compared to simpler classifiers. In fact, gradient boosting trees are the most popular method in [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/), a platform that hosts data science competitions. The top entry in the [**Netflix Prize**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize) Competition, one of the most famous data science competitions, was based on an ensemble predictive model. \n",

    "The most commmon ensemble methods use decision trees as the members of the ensemble. Scikit-learn implemenst two types of Tree Ensembles, random forests and gradient boosting.

    "\n",
    "The tree ensemble in random forests is built by training individual decision trees on different subsets of the training data and using a subset of the available features.

In fact, according to Scikit-learn documentation for the [RandomForestClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier) \"The predicted class of an input sample is a vote by the trees in the forest, weighted by their probability estimates. That is, the predicted class is the one with highest mean probability estimate across the trees.\" For regression, the prediction is the average of the individual predictions of each tree. \n",
