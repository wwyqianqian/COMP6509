    "### Coordinate Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture, we saw how the steepest decent algorithm works. Here, we explain another approach. It is known as *coordinate descent*. In coordinate descent, we choose to move one parameter at a time. Ideally, we design an algorithm that at each step moves the parameter to its minimum value. At each step we choose to move the individual parameter to its minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the minimum, we look for the point in the curve where the gradient is zero. This can be found by taking the gradient of $E(m,c)$ with respect to the parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update for Offset\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the parameter $c$ first. The gradient goes nicely through the summation operator, and we obtain\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\text{d}E(m,c)}{\\text{d}c} = -\\sum_{i=1}^n 2(y_i-mx_i-c).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Now we want the point that is a minimum. A minimum is an example of a [*stationary point*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_point), the stationary points are those points of the function where the gradient is zero. They are found by solving the equation for $\\frac{\\text{d}E(m,c)}{\\text{d}c} = 0$. Substituting in to our gradient, we can obtain the following equation, \n",
    "$$\n",
    "0 = -\\sum_{i=1}^n 2(y_i-mx_i-c)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which can be reorganised as follows,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c^* = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-m^*x_i)}{n}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The fact that the stationary point is easily extracted in this manner implies that the solution is *unique*. There is only one stationary point for this system. Traditionally when trying to determine the type of stationary point we have encountered we now compute the *second derivative*,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\text{d}^2E(m,c)}{\\text{d}c^2} = 2n.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The second derivative is positive, which in turn implies that we have found a minimum of the function. This means that setting $c$ in this way will take us to the lowest point along that axes."

    "\n",

There are lots of other macros as well, for example we can do greek letters such as `$\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$` rendering as $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$.

The term seems complicated, but they are actually based on rather a simple idea.

The covariates are the observations that move with the target (or *response*) variable. In our notation we have been using $\\mathbf{x}_i$ to represent a vector of the covariates associated with the $i$th observation. The coresponding response variable is $y_i$. If a model is non-linear in the inputs, it means that there is a non-linear function between the inputs and the response variable. Linear functions are functions that only involve multiplication and addition, in other words they can be represented through *linear algebra*.
